# The Knight's Tour

The aim of the knight's tour game is to use the chess knight's movements to traverse the chess board, visiting each square exactly once.

This react app allows users attempt to complete the tour or view a solution to the game (when a starting square is selected).

In 2017 , I made (with a partner for a university course) a Pygame Python version of this game that allows the user set the dimensions of the chessboard and also provides a computer solution.
